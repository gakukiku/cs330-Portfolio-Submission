# cs330-Portfolio-Submission

For this project, I approached software design by first breaking down the scene into simple shapes and creating a basic layout. Through this process, I improved my ability to think spatially and manage object positioning, scaling, and rotation to create a realistic environment. My design process involved starting simple, testing often, and adjusting based on visual feedback. These tactics—especially iterating gradually—can be applied to future work in graphics or other software projects.

When developing programs, I build a basic version first, then add features step-by-step. In this project, I used new development strategies like implementing camera controls (keyboard and mouse) and switching between perspective and orthographic views. Iteration was key at every stage, allowing me to refine object placement and camera movement over time. My coding style became more modular and organized through the milestones, making development easier and more efficient.

Studying computational graphics has shown me how powerful visualizations can be for understanding and presenting information. These skills will help me in future courses related to simulation, modeling, and interactive design. Professionally, the ability to build and control 3D environments will be useful in fields like game development, software engineering, or any career involving visual communication.
